## Notes

The `Get products` endpoint will fetch items one at a time or all at once depending on the use of limit and offset.

Products can be purchased both directly and after being added to a cart. I'm assuming if a product has no inventory it will simply be left in the cart. I also am not deleting the cart after completion.

There were a lot of features I would have loved to add and several elements I would have liked to improve on such as:

- Security (JWT, better error handling/checking, proper logging, etc)
- Database (improve design i.e. a user table, read and write database)
- Better docs (better comments on the code, error examples)
- Tests <- <- <-
